# :wave: Welcome to Indie Python's github profile

Indie Python is a personal project by [@KennedyRichard](https://github.com/KennedyRichard) that aims to promote fun and learning by publishing and maintaining independent Python open-source apps, games and content.

You can also find Kennedy (me) in one of those links: [github](https://github.com/KennedyRichard), [mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@KennedyRichard), [twitter](https://github.com/KennedyRichard), [email](mailto:kennedy@kennedyrichard.com).

Below we present our repositories in an organized manner to help you find useful stuff.

## Highlights (fun or popular stuff):

[Nodezator desktop app](https://github.com/IndiePython/nodezator): A multi-purpose visual node editor for the Python programming language.

[Bionic Blue desktop game](https://github.com/IndiePython/bionic-blue): an action platformer game made with the pygame library; at an early stage of development, the prototype can already be played.

## Issues and Discussions

Here in the Indie Python project we have a peculiar way of treating issues in our repositories. In summary, we reserve issues for reporting bugs that either crash the respective app or prevent an available feature to be used somehow.

This is so for the benefit of all community members and users. If anyone ever finds a critical bug in an Indie Python app/game that needs urgent care, the reported issue won't ever need to compete for attention with other items that aren't nearly as urgent. As a result, this helps ensure the issues tab are used for real issues rather than having it become a big and messy backlog or to-do list.


### Urgent/critical issues

If you find a bug that...

- causes the app to crash;
- causes something to malfunction or not work at all;

...then, please, use GitHub issues to submit an issue as soon as possible.

Please, include as much information as you can:

- your operating system;
- your Python version;
- what was your goal;
- the steps that resulted in the problem;
- screenshots/videos, if applicable.

If possible, also read the app's user manual if it has one, to ensure you are doing everything as they are supposed to be done. I often find myself wondering if I there is any problem only to later find out that I was the one doing something wrong myself.

Nevertheless, never hesitate to ask for help, regardless of how much info you have about the problem or your technical expertise.


### Minor issues

If however, the problem is not as serious/urgent, that is, it doesn't cause the app to crash or malfunction, then, please, open a discussion on GitHub discussions instead. The discussion tab for some repos even have a dedicated category for this kind of problem called "Minor issue".

It doesn't mean your issue is any less important. It is just that in Indie Python repos we use GitHub issues for things that crash the app or otherwise prevent the user from doing something that is supposed to be available (stuff that cause crashes or malfunctioning). When such a critical issue appears, any other work is paused and all attention is given to that issue so that it can be fixed ASAP.

This measure is taken for the benefit of the users: by doing things this way, whenever you have an urgent/critical issue, it won't compete for space with other less urgent matters. We'll be able to promptly schedule time to solve the issue.

Minor issues, suggestions of improvements, feature requests, feedback about bad experiences, etc. are all important, but they don't have the same urgency as something that crashes the app or causes it to malfunction. This is why we use GitHub discussions for the less urgent stuff. They'll be tended to all the same, just not with the same urgency.

Of course, GitHub discussions are used for many other important stuff as well, as we'll see in the next subsection.


### Discussions/forum

We often consider the discussions tab of a repo as the official online forum for that repo.

It is used for many things like announcements to the community, to list planned/requested features, to communicate and discuss current work, etc.

If you have...

- feedback;
- suggestions;
- ideas;
- concerns;
- questions;
- constructive criticism;
- minor issues that don't cause the app to crash or malfunction;

...you are encouraged to post there.


### Indie Python discussions

The Indie Python organization profile also has a [discussion tab](https://github.com/orgs/IndiePython/discussions). Discussions held there are just like discussions for any other repository, but they should be used for matters involving the whole project/community, rather than an specific repo/app/game.

So, all things presented in the subsection above about discussions also apply to the more general Indie Python discussions, but the matters should be related to the Indie Python project itself, rather than its repos.
